## Local Cuisine

I’m also excited to try traditional Czech dishes such as:

- **Goulash**: A hearty meat stew that’s perfect for warming up on chilly days.
- **Trdelník**: A sweet pastry that’s often topped with sugar and filled with various toppings.

## Tips for Traveling to Prague

- **Currency**: The currency in Prague is the Czech Koruna (CZK). It’s helpful to have some local currency on hand for smaller purchases.
- **Public Transport**: The city has an efficient public transportation system, making it easy to get around and explore.
